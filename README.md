# 📘 Hands-On Machine Learning — Learning & Code Companion

This repository documents my **learning journey through the book _“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” (O’Reilly)_**, with fully implemented code examples, experiments, notes, and extensions.

The goal of this project is not just to reproduce the book’s content, but to:
- deeply understand each concept,
- implement everything from scratch,
- experiment with real-world variations, and  
- build a reusable machine learning reference library.

All code in this repository is written, tested, and structured for practical use in real ML projects.
