# Hands-On Large Language Models  
### Learning and Code Companion

This repository documents my **end-to-end learning journey through the book**  
**_Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation_ (O’Reilly)**  
with full code implementations, experiments, notes, and practical extensions.

This is not just a reproduction of the book’s material.  
It is a hands-on engineering project focused on:

- deep understanding of modern LLM systems  
- building everything from scratch  
- experimenting beyond textbook examples  
- creating reusable components for real-world applications
