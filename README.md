# 🧠 Hands-On Large Language Models  
### Learning & Code Companion

This repository documents my **end-to-end learning journey through the book**  
**_Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation_ (O’Reilly)**  
with complete code implementations, experiments, notes, and practical extensions.

This is **not** a simple reproduction of the book’s material.  
It is a hands-on **engineering project** focused on:

- building modern LLM systems from scratch  
- developing deep intuition for how LLMs work  
- extending concepts into real-world applications  
- creating reusable components for production systems
